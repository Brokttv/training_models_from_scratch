## Training LLMs from Scratch — Math + NumPy Only

Today, I'll be training LLMs from **absolute scratch** using both **math** and **code**, with **no deep learning libraries** — just **NumPy**.  
And **you** should learn to do that too. Here's why:

---

### ✅ Why Do This?

- 🧠 Build an **intuitive understanding** of what’s going on under the hood.  
- ⚙️ The low-level logic is beautiful — once you get this, everything else (PyTorch, TensorFlow, Transformers) becomes **butter-smooth**.
- 🔁 Learning NumPy first makes transitioning to PyTorch seamless — they share similar operations and logic.
- 🛠️ You’ll become a **debugging master** — because you'll actually understand what each layer and step is doing.

## 🚀 Let’s Get Started

Everything is built with:
- 🐍 **Python**
- 🧮 **NumPy**
- ❌ No high-level ML libraries

Ready to get your hands dirty with raw math and code?

## 🗂️ Agenda

### 🔹 Warm-up: Linear & Logistic Regression

We'll start simple:
- Train a **one-input linear regression** model  
- Build a **single-neuron logistic regression** model

### 🔸 Next: Neural Networks from Scratch

We’ll train:
- A **single-input, 2-layer fully connected neural network**  
- A **multi-input version**  
- All for **regression tasks**

During this part, we’ll dive into:
- The importance of **non-linearities**
- How simple mathematical tools build up to modern deep learning
