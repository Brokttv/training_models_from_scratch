## Training Large Language Models from First Principles — Using Math and NumPy Only

This project explores the training of large language models (LLMs) entirely from first principles, using only core mathematical operations and NumPy — without the aid of any deep learning frameworks.  
The goal is to offer both a practical and conceptual understanding of how LLMs work at the lowest level of abstraction.

### ✅ Why Take This Approach?

- 🧠 Develop a **deep, intuitive grasp** of the underlying mechanisms of neural networks and optimization.
- ⚙️ Understand the **mathematical foundations** that power modern machine learning frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow.
- 🔁 Mastering NumPy lays a strong groundwork for transitioning to higher-level tools — the syntax and logic are remarkably similar.
- 🛠️ Gain the ability to **debug models intelligently**, having built every layer from scratch and observed their behavior at a granular level.

## 🚀 Project Framework

All components are implemented using:
- 🐍 **Python**
- 🧮 **NumPy**
- ❌ No high-level machine learning libraries

This is a hands-on, code-first exploration designed to expose the mathematical anatomy of LLMs through implementation.

## 🗂️ Learning Roadmap

### 🔹 Part 1: Foundations — Linear and Logistic Regression

We begin with fundamental supervised learning algorithms to build intuition:
- A **one-dimensional linear regression** model  
- A **single-neuron logistic regression** model for binary classification

### 🔸 Part 2: Neural Networks from Scratch

We then extend our models to multi-layer neural networks:
- A **single-input, two-layer fully connected neural network**
- A **multi-input variant**, capable of handling vectorized features
- All focused on **regression tasks**, enabling visual interpretability of outputs

This section highlights:
- The role and necessity of **non-linear activation functions**
- How simple mathematical constructs are composed to achieve sophisticated model behavior
